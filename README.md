Description:
AVL Course Manager is a program designed to maintain information about various courses using AVL trees. The program reads course data from a file named courses.txt and allows users to add new courses along with their relevant information. Courses are entered in a specific format: Course:CreditHours#CourseCode#Department/topic1, topic2, â€¦, topicN. The program supports operations such as reading the course file, inserting new courses, updating course information, listing courses in lexicographic order with their details, listing topics associated with a course, listing courses belonging to the same department, deleting courses, and saving course information to a file named offered_courses.txt. The AVL tree data structure is utilized to efficiently manage and organize the course data, with course code serving as the key for AVL tree operations.
